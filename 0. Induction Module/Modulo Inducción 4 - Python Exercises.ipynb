    "In the previous exercise, you created a dict that allows you to get the numeric value from any lowercase letter. As you can imagine, we can use this dict not only to find the numeric value for a single letter, but to sum the values from the letters in a word, thus getting the word’s “value.” One of the games that Jewish mystics enjoy playing is to find words with the same gematria value. If two words have the same gematria value, then they’re linked in some way.  \n",

    "For example, if the function is called with the word cat, with a gematria value of 24 (3 + 1 + 20), then the function will return a list of strings, all of whose gematria values are also 24. (This will be a long list!) Any nonlowercase characters in the user’s input should count 0 toward our final score for the word. Your source for the dict words will be the Unix file you used earlier, which you can load into a list comprehension."
